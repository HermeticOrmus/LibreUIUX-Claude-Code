# Customer Sales Automation

> Agents for AI-powered customer support experiences and automated sales outreach workflows.

## Overview

It pairs an AI-driven customer support specialist with a sales automation agent to cover both sides of the customer relationship: resolving issues with empathy and automation, and nurturing leads through personalized outreach. Use this plugin when building support chatbots, designing ticket workflows, creating sales email sequences, drafting proposals, or optimizing the overall customer journey.
