# Multi-Platform Apps

> Cross-platform application development with coordinated backend, frontend, mobile, and design agents.

## Overview

This plugin provides a team of six specialized agents covering the full stack of cross-platform application development: backend architecture (APIs, microservices), frontend (React 19, Next.js 15), mobile (Flutter, SwiftUI, React Native, Kotlin Compose), and UI/UX design systems. A multi-agent command orchestrates parallel platform implementation from a shared API-first architecture.

## Contents

### Agents

| Agent | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **backend-architect** | API design (REST, GraphQL, gRPC), microservices, event-driven architecture, database selection, and scalable backend patterns with Node.js, Python, Go, or Rust. |
| **flutter-expert** | Flutter 3 and Dart 3 multi-platform development including Material Design 3, state management (Riverpod, BLoC), platform channels, and performance optimization. |
| **frontend-developer** | React 19, Next.js 15, TypeScript, modern CSS (Tailwind, CSS Modules), Server Components, streaming SSR, and Web API integration. |
| **ios-developer** | Swift 6 and SwiftUI native iOS development with structured concurrency, App Intents, WidgetKit, Core Data/SwiftData, and App Store optimization. |
| **mobile-developer** | Cross-platform mobile strategy covering React Native, Flutter, and native development with shared business logic, platform-specific UI, and CI/CD for mobile. |
| **ui-ux-designer** | Design systems, component libraries, accessibility (WCAG 2.2), user research, wireframing, prototyping, and design token management. |

### Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **multi-platform** | Multi-agent workflow that coordinates API design, parallel frontend/mobile/desktop implementation, cross-platform testing, and deployment across all target platforms. |

## Usage

- **New cross-platform feature**: Use the multi-platform command to design the API first, then implement across all platforms in parallel.
- **Backend API design**: The backend-architect agent handles service boundaries, data modeling, and API contracts.
- **Platform-specific work**: Use the dedicated agent for each platform (flutter-expert, ios-developer, frontend-developer).
- **Design system creation**: The ui-ux-designer agent builds shared component libraries and design tokens.
- **Mobile strategy**: The mobile-developer agent helps choose between React Native, Flutter, and native approaches.
