# Game Development

> Specialized agents for Unity game development and Minecraft server plugin development with Bukkit/Spigot/Paper APIs.

## Overview

This plugin covers two distinct areas of game development. The Unity agent provides comprehensive expertise for building cross-platform games with Unity 6 LTS, including rendering pipelines (URP/HDRP), C# game programming, DOTS/ECS architecture, and multiplayer networking. The Minecraft agent specializes in server-side plugin development using Bukkit, Spigot, and Paper APIs with event-driven architecture and performance engineering. Use these agents when building game mechanics, optimizing rendering performance, creating server plugins, or architecting multiplayer systems.
