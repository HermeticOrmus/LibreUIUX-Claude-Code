## 🎤 Presentation Strategy

### Opening Hook (2 min)

**Problem Statement:**
- "No matter what I try, Claude Code UI looks outdated"
- Show vague request → inconsistent result
- Show precise request → perfect result, first try

### Core Message (5 min)

**The Insight:**
- Claude understands design systems, not aesthetics
- Tailwind tokens = GPS coordinates vs "go thataway"

## ✅ Final Recommendations

### For Friday's Presentation

1. **Lead with the insight**: Claude understands systems, not aesthetics
2. **Demo design vocabulary**: Show the power of precision
3. **Acknowledge stage**: Early but valuable, especially for beginners
4. **Invite collaboration**: Help build advanced features
5. **Clear next steps**: What people can use today

### Post-Presentation Priorities

1. Add 3-5 before/after examples to beginner/
2. Create video demo of design vocabulary
3. Document one real project case study
4. Simplify intermediate examples (don't wait for perfection)
5. Engage community for advanced implementations

---

**Bottom Line**: This is a high-quality teaching resource with an excellent beginner foundation and compelling vision. The gaps are in advanced automation, not core value. Position as "learn systematic UI/UX communication" (complete) rather than "automated pipeline" (aspirational).

The design vocabulary alone justifies the repository. Everything else is upside.
