# Contributing to LibreUIUX

Welcome to the knowledge commons! This isn't just a repo—it's a collective mapping of how to communicate design intent to AI. Every contribution raises our shared understanding.

---

## Ways to contribute

### Take a Menu item

[`pantry/MENU.md`](pantry/MENU.md) lists the next pieces of work, each with a Done-when anyone can check, and names one as up next. The research behind it (competitor map, posts on X, what people said here) sits beside it in [`pantry/`](pantry/). Open items are [`[menu]` issues](https://github.com/HermeticOrmus/LibreUIUX-Claude-Code/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3Amenu); smaller starting points are under [good first issues](https://github.com/HermeticOrmus/LibreUIUX-Claude-Code/contribute). Claim one by commenting on its issue, then open a pull request that says `Closes #N`.

### Report or fix a routing miss

Every agent, command and skill has a `description` that tells Claude when to use it. When Claude picks the wrong one, or none, open a [routing miss](https://github.com/HermeticOrmus/LibreUIUX-Claude-Code/issues/new?template=routing-miss.yml) with the prompt, what should have run, and what ran instead. The fix is usually a sharper `description` in that file's frontmatter, which makes it a good first pull request.

### Propose or build a plugin

Open a [plugin proposal](https://github.com/HermeticOrmus/LibreUIUX-Claude-Code/issues/new?template=plugin-proposal.yml) first, so the job it does and its Done-when are agreed before you write it. A plugin in this repo has this layout:

```text
plugins/<name>/
├── .claude-plugin/plugin.json     # name, version, description, author, homepage, repository, license, keywords
├── README.md                      # what it does, with one example prompt
├── agents/<agent>.md              # frontmatter: name, description ("Use this agent when ..."), model: inherit
├── commands/<command>.md          # frontmatter: description, argument-hint if it takes input
└── skills/<skill>/SKILL.md        # frontmatter: name, description ("Use when ...")
```

A plugin needs only the folders it uses. Add an entry for it to `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` with `name`, `source` (`./plugins/<name>`), `description`, `version`, `author`, `homepage`, `repository`, `license`, `keywords` and `category`, matching the entries around it. `plugins/design-mastery/` and `plugins/archetypal-alchemy/` are good patterns to copy. A plugin derived from [wshobson/agents](https://github.com/wshobson/agents) keeps its upstream author and gets a line in [NOTICE.md](NOTICE.md). When the plugin count changes, update the counts in the README.

### Translate

The docs are in English only. A translation of the beginner path is a good place to start: add it next to the original with the language code (for example `beginner/README.es.md`), link it from the English file, and label the pull request `translation`.

### Share what you built

Post it in [Discussions, Show and tell](https://github.com/HermeticOrmus/LibreUIUX-Claude-Code/discussions/categories/show-and-tell): the prompt, the plugins you used, and a before and after. Good ones can become examples or Menu items.

### Test your change locally

```bash
# Load one plugin from your working tree for a single session, without installing it
claude --plugin-dir ./plugins/<name>

# Validate the marketplace, then your plugin (CI treats warnings as errors with --strict)
claude plugin validate .
claude plugin validate --strict ./plugins/<name>

# Install from your checkout into a throwaway config, the way CI does; your own config is untouched
export CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR=$(mktemp -d)
claude plugin marketplace add ./
claude plugin install <name>@libreuiux
claude plugin details <name>@libreuiux   # lists the agents and skills Claude Code found (commands show up as skills)
unset CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR
```

CI ([`.github/workflows/validate.yml`](.github/workflows/validate.yml)) runs the same checks on every pull request: it validates the marketplace, validates every plugin with `--strict`, and installs every plugin into a clean config. A first-time contributor's CI run waits until a maintainer approves it, so a pending check on your first pull request is expected.

## 🎯 Philosophy

**We share knowledge, not secrets.**

Wonder emerges from understanding elegant mechanics, not from mystification. When you contribute here, you're revealing how systems work, documenting breakthrough patterns, and building collective craft.

---

📝 **Field Notes from the Maintainers**

The best contributions we've seen share three qualities:

1. **Technical precision** - "Change from shadow-md to shadow-lg" not "make it pop"
2. **Actionable experiments** - "Try this, watch for that, here's why it works"
3. **Mechanism revelation** - Explaining WHY something works, not just that it does

The contribution that changed everything for one developer: a simple note that "Claude understands Tailwind's scale system perfectly—use it as coordinates." That single insight unlocked consistent results for dozens of people.

**Your breakthrough could do the same.**

## 🤝 Types of Contributions

### 🎯 Prompt Templates & Patterns

**What we need:**
- Prompts that consistently produce quality results
- Phrasings that work better than obvious alternatives
- Patterns that solve common problems elegantly

**How to contribute:**

1. **Test thoroughly** - Use it in real projects first
2. **Document precisely** - Exact wording matters
3. **Explain the mechanism** - Why does this work?
4. **Show the alternative** - What did you try first that didn't work?

**Template:**
```markdown
## [Component Name] Prompt

### The Problem
[What challenge does this solve?]

### The Pattern
```
[Exact prompt that works]
```

### Why This Works
[Technical explanation of the mechanism]

### Try This
[Actionable experiment readers can run]

### Watch For
[Expected results that validate understanding]

### Common Variations
- [Variant 1 with use case]
- [Variant 2 with use case]

---

📝 **Field Notes**
[Personal experience, breakthrough moment, hard-won insight]
```

**Example:**
```markdown
## Glassmorphism Card Prompt

### The Problem
Vague requests like "modern glass effect" produce inconsistent results.

### The Pattern
```
Create a card with glassmorphism:
- backdrop-blur-lg (16px blur)
- bg-white/10 (10% opacity white)
- border border-white/20 (subtle edge)
- rounded-2xl shadow-xl
- Place over a gradient or image background
```

### Why This Works
Each property has a specific job:
- `backdrop-blur-lg` - Creates the frosted glass effect
- `bg-white/10` - Subtle tint without opacity blocking content
- `border-white/20` - Defines the edge without harsh lines
- These specific values balance visibility with elegance

### Try This
1. Request the exact prompt above
2. Then try: "Create a glass-looking card"
3. Compare results

### Watch For
The specific prompt produces identical results every time. The vague version varies wildly.

---

📝 **Field Notes**

Took me 15 attempts to nail these values. Too much blur (xl) and you can't read content. Too little (md) and it doesn't feel glassy. Too opaque (bg-white/30) and it's just a white box. These ratios—blur-lg + /10 opacity—hit the sweet spot.

Now I use this pattern everywhere: modals, navigation, overlays. Works perfectly every time.
```

## 📝 Voice & Style

Read [VOICE_GUIDE.md](./VOICE_GUIDE.md) before contributing. Key points:

### The Formula
```
Technical Rigor:      45%  - Precise, accurate, systematic
Profound Wonder:      30%  - Genuine awe at elegant mechanics
Hacker Playfulness:   20%  - Insightful, clever, revealing
Warm Encouragement:    5%  - Supportive, remember the beginner
```

### Sound Like
- **Carl Sagan** revealing cosmic mechanics (wonder through understanding)
- **Richard Feynman** explaining physics (joy in precision)
- **A senior engineer** showing the elegant solution (system mastery)
- **A generous mentor** who remembers being a beginner

### Don't Sound Like
- ❌ Mystical guru with secrets
- ❌ Dry academic textbook
- ❌ Corporate training manual
- ❌ Motivational speaker

### Examples

**❌ Too dry:**
```
Specify shadow-lg for elevated elements.
```

**❌ Too mystical:**
```
The shadow-lg value channels the ancient wisdom of depth and elevation...
```

**✅ Just right:**
```
Here's what's elegant about shadow-lg: it's not just "more shadow." It's a
precise z-axis position in a coordinate system. Claude understands exactly how
much elevation you mean. That precision is why it works consistently.
```

💛 **Gold Hat Note**
Topic: The Nature of Contribution

When you contribute to this repository, you're not just adding content. You're expanding the map of human-AI collaboration in design.

Every prompt pattern you document? Territory mapped.
Every mechanism you explain? Understanding deepened.
Every breakthrough you share? Collective craft advanced.

Your contribution might seem small to you—just one prompt template, one workflow, one insight. But someone, somewhere, will build something meaningful because you documented what you learned.

That's not hypothetical. That's how knowledge commons work.

Share what you discover. The craft grows when knowledge flows.
